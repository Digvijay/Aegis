## Executive Summary
This report compares the **Aegis Geometric Integrity Protocol (GIP)** against standard **Recursive Character Splitting**. The goal is to measure "Structural Fragmentation"—the primary cause of RAG hallucinations.

| Comparison Metric | Aegis GIP (Deterministic) | Industry Standard (Probabilistic) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Overall Integrity Score** | **9.1/10** | **4.1/10** |
| Structural Fidelity | 9.8/10 | 9.8/10 |
| Semantic Coherence | 9.3/10 | 4.3/10 |
| Context Fidelity | 9.0/10 | 4.0/10 |

## Judge Verdict
**Aegis GIP Result**: Evaluation for Aegis GIP. Structural markers perfectly preserved.

**Industry Standard Result**: Evaluation for Standard Splitter. Significant fragmentation in tabular data.
