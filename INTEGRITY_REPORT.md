## Executive Summary
This report provides an empirical comparison between **Aegis Geometric Integrity Protocol** and a **Standard Recursive Splitter**. Evaluation was performed on `technical_paper.pdf`.

| Metric | Aegis GIP | Standard Splitter | Improvement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Structural Fidelity** | 9.8/10 | 4.1/10 | **+5.7** |
| **Semantic Coherence** | 9.5/10 | 4.3/10 | **+5.2** |
| **Context Fidelity** | 9.7/10 | 3.8/10 | **+5.9** |

## Judge Verdicts (Gemini 3 Flash)

### 🟢 Aegis GIP
> Aegis GIP perfectly preserved the 'Sieve of Eratosthenes' code (Figure 1) and 'Trace-Monkey State Machine' (Figure 2). Chunks are logically bounded by document structure, ensuring zero fragmentation of technical diagrams.

### 🔴 Standard Splitter
> Standard splitting 'shredded' Figure 3 (LIR Snippet) across three chunks, making the code unreadable for RAG. Word fragmentation was observed (e.g., 'adynamicc' split from 'ompilerfor').

## Final Conclusion
Aegis GIP demonstrates a profound advantage in technical document ingestion. By respecting the **Geometric Invariants** of the PDF layout, it eliminates the 'Fragmented Context' problem which is the primary cause of hallucination in technical RAG systems.
