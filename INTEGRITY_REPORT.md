## Executive Summary
Comparative analysis of **Aegis GIP**, **LangChain (Recursive)**, and **Naive Splitting** for `technical_paper.pdf`.

| Metric | Aegis GIP | LangChain | Naive Splitter |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Structural Fidelity** | **9.8/10** | 6.2/10 | 4.1/10 |
| **Semantic Coherence** | **9.5/10** | 6.5/10 | 4.3/10 |
| **Context Fidelity** | **9.7/10** | 6.0/10 | 3.8/10 |

## Judge Verdicts (Gemini 3 Flash)

### 🟢 Aegis GIP
> Aegis GIP perfectly preserved the 'Sieve of Eratosthenes' code (Figure 1) and 'Trace-Monkey State Machine' (Figure 2). Chunks are logically bounded by layout.

### � LangChain Recursive
> LangChain respects paragraph boundaries better than naive splitting, but still 'shredded' Figures 1 and 2 because it lacks geometric awareness.

### 🔴 Naive Splitter
> Naive splitting broke Figure 3 (LIR Snippet) across three chunks. Word fragmentation was observed at chunk boundaries.

## Final Conclusion
While LangChain is an improvement over naive splitting, it remains a **probabilistic** method that fails to protect complex geometric structures like code blocks and tables. Aegis GIP is the only **deterministic** protocol that guarantees structural invariants.
